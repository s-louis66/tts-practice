			<h2 class="head-home"> Music </h2>
			<p>Music has a connection to the most of me. In a way, music defines who 
			I am and withought it I believe it would of been harder for me to find
			a sense of who I am. I am a listener of many genres.

			<h2 class="head-home">Science</h2>
			<p>I have always been fascinated by the creation of God including the 
			universe he has created. I know there are many things we have yet to
			answer about it and its correlation with God but I truly believe in
			the Faith I have in him and the things he has done for me. We all might 
			not agree on the same thing but we sure can try, with our best, to
			understand and accept each other.

			<h2 class="head-home">Autobiography</h2>
			<p>This is really just a form page for  you to describe things about
			yourself in a <i>special</i> way.

			<h2 class="head-home">JavaScript</h2>
			<p>I plan on getting better every day drawing not only with JavaScript, 
			but also learning how to use JavaScript with every day websites. I would also
			, eventually, go into more scripting languages as I aspire to become a full-stack
			developer. The limit is in your head.

			<h2 class="head-home">Beautiful NC</h2><br>
			<p>I was raised in a small town called Stanfield in North Carolina.
			It is definitely one of those small towns where almost everyone 
			seems to know each other. Not only the town but the whole county,
			honestly. In a way, you can see it as a "small" county. I have yet
			to visit the mountain side of NC but I am sure it won't be long before 
			I start that journey.
			</p>
			<p> It seems like, to me, that North Carolina is the ideal and most perfect
			place to live or retire. This beauty of a state comes equipped with both,
			excitement and relaxation that you can only find in this state. I am aware 
			that there are many other states that offer these luxuries but none in the
			style of NC.
			</p>
			<p> To the Appalachian mountains that stretch vertically at the west of this 
			nation to the spectacular views of the beaches of Wilmington and of the Outer
			Banks, NC is definitely filled with many adventures longing to be seeked. The 
			views of the Apps are definitely something worth seeing and the strolls at Wrightsville
			Beach are worth enjoying for neither will fail you.
